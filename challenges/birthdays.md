# Birthday Problem

**ðŸŽ¯ Calculate probabilities**

You're at a party. There are a total of N people present. Calculate how likely it is that at least two people will have a birthday on the same day.

## Hints

* there are at least two people at the party
* assume that birthdays occur on all days of the year with the same probability.
* ignore leap years

## Questions

* How many people have to be there for a >50% or >90% chance?
* What is the probability that there are two or more pairs?
* consider when the assumption that all days have the same probability makes sense
