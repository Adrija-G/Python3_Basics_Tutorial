# Google Search

**ðŸŽ¯ Send a search query from a Python program to the search engine Google.**

### Task 1

Download the website `www.google.de` with Python.

### Task 2

Inspect the HTML page in a text editor.
Find the form with the search field.

### Task 3

Perform a Google search from Python. Research how to fill out a form submitting a POST-request.

Display search results on screen.


## Hints:

* The `requests` module helps to send the search query.
* The form uses HTTP POST.
* There is at least one *'hidden'* field in the form that you must specify.
**Selenium** is a convenient alternative (but harder to install)
