# Ping-Pong

**ðŸŽ¯ Exchange a message between two programs over the network.**

* implement a webserver in Python
* the server should accept a name as parameter and send back the string *'Hello <NAME>'*.
* write a second program (client) that sends a name to the server
* start the server and the client


## Hints:

* `flask` is suitable for the server.
* to access the server from the client you can use `requests`.
* no HTML required
