# Datetime Indexes

To prepare for the challenge, create 30 random numbers:

    :::python3
    import numpy as np
    r = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=30)

Solve the following tasks:

    :::python3
    # 1. create timestamps for an entire April, one per day

    # 2. display the year for each timestamp
    
    # 3. display the weekday for each timestamp

    # 4. create a Series with the random data and the timestamps as index 
    
    # 5. select the timestamps until the 11th

    # 6. calculate the total number per week

    # 7. calculate a rolling average with a 7-day window
