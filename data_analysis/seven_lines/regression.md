# Linear Regression

To prepare for the challenge, execute the following lines::

    :::python3
    import seaborn as sns

    df = sns.load_dataset('penguins')

Solve the following tasks:

    :::python3
    # 1. drop the missing values

    # 2. define the bill length as an independent variable (X)

    # 3. define the body mass as the dependent variable (y)

    # 4. perform a train-test-split

    # 5. fit a linear model on the training data

    # 6. calculate a R^2 score on the training data

    # 7. calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the training and test data
