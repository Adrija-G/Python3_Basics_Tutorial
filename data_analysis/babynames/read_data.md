![Babynamen](images/baby.png)

The US authorities have registered the names of all US citizens born since 1880. The record is [publicly available](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). For data protection reasons, only names that have been used at least 5 times are listed in the data record.


## Preparations

* Download the dataset of US baby names from [www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) .
* Unzip the file

----

## Task 1

Read the file **'yob2000.txt'**, print the first 10 lines and write the data to another file.

----

## Task 2

Write a program that reads the file **'yob2000.txt'**, calculates the sum of the third column and prints it.

----

## Task 3

Like Task 2, but calculate the sum for boys and girls separately.

----

## Task 4

Write a program that displays all names that occur at least 1000 times in the **'yob2000.txt'** file.

----

## Task 5

Calculate for each name in **'yob2000.txt'** its percentage of total births. Store this percentage as a fourth column.

----

## Task 6

Like Task 5, but separated by boys and girls.

----

## Task 7

Add an additional column containing the length of the name. Output the 10 longest names.

----

## Task 8

Find all rows that contain a certain name (e.g. your own).

----

## Task 9

Create a list with the years **`[1880, 1881, 1882 ... 2015]`**.

----

## Task 10

Create a list of file names **['yob1880.txt', 'yob1881.txt' ... 'yob2015.txt']**.

----

## Task 11

Select a name. Create a table containing a subset of the data: the *year* and the number of babies with this name.

----

## Task 12

Like Task 11, but also control the gender.

## Task 13

Same as Task 12, but use a 0 if a name does not occur in a year.


## Task 14

Investigate the popularity of the first names of some US celebrities over the last 130 years. Display matches for a name with *year* and *number* on the screen.

The following celebrities might be interesting:
