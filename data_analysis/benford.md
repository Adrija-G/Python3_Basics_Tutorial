# Benford Analysis

**ðŸŽ¯ Conduct a Benford analysis..**

The **Benford distribution** is a statistic that can be used, for example, to determine manipulations in accounting.
The basic idea is to observe that the number 1 occurs most frequently when counting things, the number 2 occurs second most frequently, and so on.

* Load a table from the [Gapminder dataset](http:/www.gapminder.org)
* Count how often each digit occurs
* Compare the result with the theoretical Benford distribution.
