# Recursive Graphics

**ðŸŽ¯ Write a programm that draws the Koch curve.**

With the parameter `n=1` draw a basic shape composed of four lines:

![n=1](images/snowflake1.png)

If you increase `n`, each line should be replaced by a smaller edition of the basic shape. For example, with `n=2` you should get:

![n=2](images/snowflake2.png)

and with `n=5`:

![n=5](images/snowflake3.png)


## Hints

* without **recursion** you won't get very far
* use `turtle` or `pillow` for drawing

## Extra Challenge

* Modify the basic shape so that the result is a bush or tree instead of a snowflake.
