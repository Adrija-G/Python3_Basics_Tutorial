# Anagrams

**ðŸŽ¯ Generate all anagrams of a word with 3-6 letters.**

For example, the string:

    ROT

has the anagrams (permutations of characters):

    TOR
    ORT
    TRO
    RTO
    OTR

## Hints

* Try the function `itertools.permutations()`.

## Extra challenges

* Get yourself a word list. Find anagrams that are real words.
* Implement the algorithm to generate the anagrams yourself. Get informed about **dynamic programming**.
