**ðŸŽ¯ Create your own website and publish it on the web.**

## Hints:

* The [Django Girls Tutorial](https://djangogirls.org/resources/) provides an excellent tutorial for beginners.
* If you already have some experience with web servers, you can also start with the **Flask Mega-Tutorial** or **How to build your own Django Website**.
* For publishing you can try **Pythonanywhere** or **Heroku**. It costs nothing.
