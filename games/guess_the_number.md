# Guess the Number

**🎯 Implement a simple guessing game.**

The player tries to guess a number that the computer has generated.

1. The program randomly *"rolls"* a number between 1 and 100.
2. **Do not** output the number.
3. The player enters a number.
4. The program says whether the number was too big or too small.
5. Repeat steps 3-5 until the correct number was guessed.

### Example output:
