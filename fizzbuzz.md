# Fizz-Buzz-Test

**ðŸŽ¯ Write a program that runs through the numbers from 1 to 100:**

* If the number is divisible by 3, the program outputs *"Fizz"*.
* If the number is divisible by 5, the program outputs *"Buzz"*.
* If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, the program outputs *"FizzBuzz"*.
* otherwise the number is printed

## Note

The **Fizz Buzz Test** has often been used at interviews to sort out applicants who cannot program at all.
