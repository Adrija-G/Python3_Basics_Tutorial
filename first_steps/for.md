### In this chapter you will learn to:

| area    | topic |
|---------|-------|
| ‚öô | use `for` loops |
| ‚öô | indent instructions |
| üí° | use the `range()` function |
| üí° | use the `time` module |
| üêû | recognize bugs at runtime |

----

### Exercise 1: Pat your own shoulder

Execute the following program.
What happens?

    :::python3
    import time

    for i in range(5):
        print("You are great at programming!")
        time.sleep(5)

----

### Exercise 2: Counting

Execute the following two lines:

    :::python3
    for zahl in range(1, 7):
        print(zahl)

Make the code print the numbers from 1 to 20.

----

### Exercise 3: Prints

Explain why the `for`-loop is better than this code sniplet:

    :::python3
    print(1)
    print(2)
    print(3)
    print(4)
    print(5)
    print(6)
    print(7)

----

### Exercise 4: Indentation

Explain the difference between the following two programs:

    :::python3
    x = 1
    for i in range(10):
        x = x * 2
        print(x)

and

    :::python3
    x = 1
    for i in range(10):
        x = x * 2
    print(x)


----

### Exercise 5: Squares

Implement a `for` loop that produces the following output:

    :::bash
    1
    4
    9
    16
    25
    36
    49

----

### Exercise 6: More loops

Execute the following loops one by one.

    :::python3
    for char in "ABCD":
        print(char)

    for i in range(10):
        print(i)

    for number in [4, 9, 16, 25]:
        print(number)

    for x, y in [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)]:
        print(x, y)

    rabbits = 10
    for i in range(9):
         rabbits = rabbits + rabbits // 5
         print(rabbits)
