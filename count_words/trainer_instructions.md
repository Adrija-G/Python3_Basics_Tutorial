# Counting words in Moby Dick - Instruction for trainers

**An exercise using multi-staged learning aids**

## Summary

This exercise exemplifies how learning aid cards can be structured in such a way that they do not provide too many answers for lazy students. The exercise itself has been performed in practice without learning aid cards only – and no further material.

## Learning Goals

Use a dictionary data type for counting things.
Use list data type to sort information.

## Task

Write a program that counts how often each word occurs in the book "Moby Dick" by Herman Melville, and output the words, starting with the most frequent ones, and how often they occur.

## Requirements

* basic knowledge of Python programming (www.python.org)
* basic operations on strings, dictionaries, and lists
* `for` loops
* reading text files

## Material

* Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick”, available as a text file from http://www.gutenberg.org   
* Python programming environment.
* hint cards
